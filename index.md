### CPSC 120

*Lab 5
    Lab 5 was a favorite because it offered practical challenges that helped me 
    sharpen my core programming skills. Working with if statements to handle 
    domain logic taught me how to control program flow effectively. Moreover,
    the experience of structuring my project with multiple files improved my 
    ability to organize and maintain code, while the use of unit tests ensured 
    that my solutions were reliable and accurate.

*Lab 8
    Lab 8 was a standout for me because it was both fun and insightful. Validating
    and navigating command-line arguments gave me hands-on experience with an essential
    aspect of programming. Additionally, working with loops, including nested ones, 
    helped me master processing values and even printing intricate patterns, which was
    an engaging and rewarding challenge.

*Lab 10:
    Lab 10 was an engaging experience that taught me how to work with 2D vectors.
    Writing function definitions was a key aspect of the lab, helping me understand 
    how to structure code more efficiently and improve reusability. Using unit tests 
    to guide my development process ensured that my work was consistent and correct, 
    which was invaluable for building confidence in my coding abilities.
